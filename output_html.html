<b>o f Songs on Passover</b>? 1
</p>
<p><b><i>Benjamin Edidin Scolnic
</i></b></p>
<p>T <b>hat Jewish tradition associates the Song of Songs with Passover is a</b> 
<b>quaint fact which is often cited but very rarely deeply considered. It</b> 
</p>
<p><b>would seem that if we read the Song of Songs as an anthology of erotic love</b> 
<b>poetry, the best that we can do is to mention the references to spring in the</b> 
<b>biblical book and refer to Passover as the major festival of that season. As</b> 
<b>Isaac Klein put it,
</b></p>
<p><b>. . .  on the Sabbath of the festival it is customary to read the Song of</b> 
<b>Songs with its description of spring. This constitutes our recognition</b> 
<b>that the forces in the physical environment which make for physical</b> 
<b>survival and well-being have a divine source.2
</b></p>
<p><b>This is a rather perfunctory and somewhat forced connection between the</b> 
<b>festival and the biblical book. It is true that the Song of Songs contains a</b> 
<b>famous and beautiful passage about spring:
</b></p>
<p><b>My beloved spoke thus to me:
Arise, my darling;
My fair one, come away!
For now the winter is past,
The rains are over and gone.
The blossoms have appeared in the land,
The time of pruning has come;
